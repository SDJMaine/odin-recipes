simple website for recipes (TOP)

The current project is an introduction into utilizing my html skills, relying on my knowledge and my ability to have and use resources to complete a project that is not itself a code-along. 

Once I have completed this project, I would have shown my ability to create and format a basic website using html, I would have shown that I can use git and Github properly, as well as showing that I can commit effectively.
